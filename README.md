# car-accident-detection-Proteus-
This project implements an IoT-based smart vehicle safety and accident monitoring system using sensors like accelerometer, vibration, gas, GPS, and GSM modules. It detects accidents, tracks location, and sends alerts. The system is simulated using Proteus and can be executed by running the acc.pdsprj file.
